NC_000962.3,Mycobrowser_v3,CDS,4174873,4178070,.,+,0,Rv3728,Rv3728,Unknown, but seems involved in efflux system (probably sugar or drug transport).,Probable conserved two-domain membrane protein,Rv3728, (MTV025.076), len: 1065 aa. Probable conserved transmembrane protein organised into two domains. Domain comprising the first ~510 aa residues is similar to various multidrug resistance and efflux proteins and contains sugar transport protein signature 1 (PS00216). Domain corresponding to the last 550 aa residues contains cyclic nucleotide-binding domain signature 2 (PS00889) and is very similar to Q50733|YP65_MYCTU|Rv2565|MT2641|MTCY9C4.03c hypothetical 62.1 kDa protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (31.0% identity in 546 aa overlap). Highly similar to O05884|Rv3239c|MTCY20B11.14c probable transmembrane transport protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1048 aa) FASTA scores: opt: 4328, E(): 5e-201, (64.15% identity in 1046 aa overlap). N-terminal end similar to P71879|Rv2333c|MTCY3G12.01|MTCY98.02c (537 aa); P71836|Rv0783c|MTCY369.27c (540 aa); and O07753|Rv1877|MTCY180.41c (687 aa). Seems belong to the sugar transporter family. Possibly member of major facilitator superfamily (MFS).,O69695,No,cell wall and cell processes,ML2340,MMAR_2964,,Mb3755,,,,
NC_000962.3,Mycobrowser_v3,CDS,4178285,4180615,.,+,0,Rv3729,Rv3729,Function unknown; probably involved in cellular metabolism.,Possible transferase,Rv3729, (MTV025.077), len: 776 aa. Conserved hypothetical protein, possible transferase, similar to several hypothetical proteins and various transferases e.g. O26919|MTH831 molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis MOAA homolog from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (497 aa), FASTA scores: opt: 697, E(): 4.8e-34, (30.7% identity in 492 aa overlap); Q58036|Y619_METJA|MJ0619 hypothetical protein from Methanococcus jannaschii (506 aa), FASTA scores: opt: 670, E(): 2e-32, (30.6% identity in 497 aa overlap); O27968|AF2316 conserved hypothetical protein from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (518 aa), FASTA scores: opt: 477, E(): 6.4e-21, (29.4% identity in 500 aa overlap); BAB60102|TVG0985801 molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein from Thermoplasma volcanium (606 aa), FASTA scores: opt: 402, E(): 2.1e-16, (28.1% identity in 509 aa overlap); etc. C-terminus similar to methyltransferases e.g. Q9S0N6|AVED C5-O-methyltransferase from Streptomyces avermitilis (283 aa), FASTA scores: opt: 298, E(): 1.9e-10, (31.5% identity in 292 aa overlap). Also similar to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins P71673|YE05_MYCTU|Rv1405c|MT1449|MTCY21B4.22c (274 aa); and Q50584|Rv1523|MTCY19G5.05c.,O69696,No,intermediary metabolism and respiration,,,,Mb3756
